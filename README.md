# Graph-embeddings
Various programs that calculate the genus of different graph embeddings.  

A graph has a finite number of topological embeddings of orientable and non-orientable surfaces, up to some equivalence.  These can be modelled using permutations.  These programs take a graph of interest, and generate all of its embeddings using this permutation model.  Then, statistics of interest are calculated using these embeddings: average number of faces, average genus, genus polynomial, roots of genus polynomial e.t.c.

A Jupyter notebook showing some example calculations is also given.
